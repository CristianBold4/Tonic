# Tonic algorithm for estimating triangles in graph streams

Here are the instruction for running *Tonic* algorithm: **T**iangles c**O**unti**N**g with pred**IC**tions, for both
insertion-only and fully-dynamic graph streams. 
Code is deployed in *C++ 17* under *gcc 9.4.0* compiler. Additionally, *CMake 3.16+* is required.

We provide some examples of datasets and oracles inside the respective folders, so that you can skip directly 
to step (4) after having compiled the sources.


1. Compile the code
   <br><br>
   `bash compile.sh`
   <br><br>
   The binaries will be generated inside the `build` folder.
   <br><br>

2. Preprocess the raw dataset
   <br><br>
   `./build/DataPreprocessing <dataset_path> <delimiter> <skip> <output_path>`
   <br><br>
   where *dataset_path* is the filepath to the dataset to be preprocessed, 
*delimiter* is the character used to separate the rows in the dataset, 
*skip* is the number of lines to skip before starting to read the dataset, and *output_path* is the 
path where the preprocessed dataset will be saved.
   <br><br>

3. Build the Oracle
   <br><br>
    `./build/BuildOracle <preprocessed_dataset_path> <type of the oracle = {Exact, noWR, Node}> 
<percentage_retain> <output_path> [wr_size]`
   <br><br>
   where *preprocessed_dataset_path* is the path to the preprocessed dataset at point (2),
*type of the oracle* is the type of oracle to be built (Exact, noWR, Node),
*percentage_retain* is the fraction of top heavies edges/nodes to be retained in the oracle,
*output_path* is the path where the oracle will be saved, and *wr_size* is the size of the waiting room for excluding
the counts (only for the noWR oracle).
   <br><br>

4. Run *Tonic* Algorithm:
   <br><br>
    `./build/Tonic Tonic <flag: 0: insertion-only stream, 1: fully-dynamic stream> <random_seed> <memory_budget> <alpha> 
<beta> <dataset_path> <oracle_path> <oracle_type = [nodes, edges]> <output_path>`
   <br><br>
   where *flag* is the type of the input stream (0 for insertion-only, 1 for fully-dynamic), 
*random_seed* is the seed for the random number generator,
*memory_budget* is the memory budget for the algorithm,
*alpha* and *beta* are the parameters for fraction of size of WR and H,
*preprocessed_dataset_path* is the path to the preprocessed dataset at point (2),
*oracle_path* is the path to the oracle at point (3),
*oracle_type* is the type of oracle used (nodes or edges), and
*output_path* is the path where the output will be saved.

### Graph Sequences:
This kind of datasets consists in a collection of consecutive graphs registered each in a given time of interval, 
meaning that the topology betweeen each graph is only slightly varying in terms of nodes and edges (and, consequently triangles).
